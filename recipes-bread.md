# Steps Detail
1. Combine Ingredients: \
I use a food safe bucket to combine ingredients usually going by feel. Add flour first then hot water from the tap. The most important ratio is the water to flour, I usually aim for about 700 grams of flour and 75% of that weight in water but I do not measure. Mix with dough whisk after you add water and add a little more water or flour if necessary, you want the resulting dough to be 'shaggy'. Wait roughly 30 min for the dough to autolyse then add a tablespoon of salt and less than a teaspoon of yeast.

2. Fold: \
Give it a few folds after you add the salt and yeast, making sure not to tear as you fold. Give it a few minutes of folding every couple of hours. This will help the dough come together and feel less wet. Tip: wet your hands before you fold, you will get way less dough stuck to your hands and the extra water added is negligible.

3. Transfer to proofing basket \
When the dough has passed its initial rise give it a final fold and try to get it in a uniform ball. It's ok to get a lot of the bubbles out during this final fold. The timing of this step depends on temperature, moisture, salinity, and quantity of yeast added in Step 1 but in general you want to do this while the dough is on the way up not the way down. If you see that the dough rose higher than it currently is sitting in the bucket you caught it on the way down. I still bake my failures and sometimes they end up better than you might expect. If you ended up with a lot of dough you may want to divide it in 2 before you shape it. Generously dust both your rattan proofing basket and the ball of dough itself with flour. If this is your first time using the proofing basket it will take a lot of flour. I opt to use the basket without the fabric cover that comes with them sometimes, I find it less likely to stick to the wood by itself.
