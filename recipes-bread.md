# Steps Detail
1. Combine Ingredients
I use a food safe bucket to combine ingredients usually going by feel. The most important ratio is the water to flour, I usually aim for about 700 grams of flour and 75% of that weight in water but I do not measure. Mix with dough whisk after you add water and add a little more water or flour if necessary, you want the resulting dough to be 'shaggy'. Wait roughly 30 min for the dough to autolyse then add a tablespoon of salt and less than a teaspoon of yeast.

2. Give it a few folds after you add the salt and yeast, making sure not to tear as you fold. Give it a few minutes of folding every couple of hours.
