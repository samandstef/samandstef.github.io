# Steps Detail
1. Combine Ingredients: \
I use a food safe bucket to combine ingredients usually going by feel. Add flour first then hot water from the tap. The most important ratio is the water to flour, I usually aim for about 700 grams of flour and 75% of that weight in water but I do not measure. Mix with dough whisk after you add water and add a little more water or flour if necessary, you want the resulting dough to be 'shaggy'. Wait roughly 30 min for the dough to autolyse then add a tablespoon of salt and less than a teaspoon of yeast.

2. Fold: \
Give it a few folds after you add the salt and yeast, making sure not to tear as you fold. Give it a few minutes of folding every couple of hours. This will help the dough come together and feel less wet. Tip: wet your hands before you fold, you will get way less dough stuck to your hands and the extra water added is negligible. Let it rise for 10 hours at room temp give or take.

3. Transfer to proofing basket \
When the dough has passed its initial rise give it a final fold and try to get it in a uniform ball. It's ok to get a lot of the bubbles out during this final fold. The timing of this step depends on temperature, moisture, salinity, and quantity of yeast added in Step 1 but in general you want to do this while the dough is on the way up not the way down. If you see that the dough rose higher than it currently is sitting in the bucket you caught it on the way down. I still bake my failures and sometimes they end up better than you might expect. If you ended up with a lot of dough you may want to divide it in 2 before you shape it. Generously dust both your rattan proofing basket and the ball of dough itself with flour. If this is your first time using the proofing basket it will take a lot of flour. I opt to use the basket without the fabric cover that comes with them sometimes, I find it less likely to stick to the wood by itself.

4. Bake \
Let it proof in the baskets either overnight in the fridge or for a couple hours on the countertop. Preheat the oven with a dutch oven inside to its max temperature for around half an hour. Place the dough upside down on parchment paper. You can score it if you want. Then put it in the dutch oven and back in the oven with the lid on and reduce the temperature to 475F. After 30min take the lid off, spin the loaf around and take a look. Usually bake it for around 20 more minutes at the same temperature. You have some discretion on how dark you like your crust. If you don't have a dutch oven you can follow the same steps with a pizza stone, when you put it in the oven add some water in a pan below to add steam.

6. Rest and eat \
Let it rest for half an hour before you open it. You can hear it crackling when you take it out. I like to eat mine with labneh, zaatar, and olive oil.
