# Steps Detail
1. Marinate: \
Remove the thin membrane on the back of the ribs using a knife and towel. Then cut ribs into 2-5 sections and place in large ziplocs, add oyster sauce on top. Let marinate between 1/2 a day and 2 days.

2. Bake: \
Preheat oven at 325.
Put ribs in dishes and cover with aluminum foil.
Let bake between 1hr 45min and 2hr.

3. Grill \
Grill on high heat to finish. This is just for flavor as the ribs will already be cooked through. Watch out I crisped mine recently, the pork fat is flammable.
